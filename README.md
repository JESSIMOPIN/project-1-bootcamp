## Project Description/Outline
This project aims to identify the key factors that contribute to a movie's success by analyzing a comprehensive database of films. It seeks to answer questions about the influence of factors such as genre, actors, director, and budget on a movie's performance, and ultimately define the characteristics of a "perfect" movie. The findings will provide actionable insights for filmmakers, studios, and investors in the film industry.

## Research Questions to Answer
- Do specific movie genres have a more significant impact on success, and can certain genres be considered more lucrative than others?
- How do the selection of actors and their star power influence a movie's success? Can we identify specific actors that are more likely to lead to success?
- Is there a correlation between a movie's budget and its level of success?
- Can we create a predictive model or formula that accurately forecasts a movie's success based on a combination of these factors?
- What are the limitations and challenges in using data analysis to determine the success of a movie, and how might these limitations affect the project's findings?

## Dataset to be used
